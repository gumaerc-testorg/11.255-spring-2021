Every student is expected to come to class familiar with the assigned scenarios - when applicable - and ready to apply the ideas covered in the assigned readings. Scenario leaders (each student will fill this role twice over the course of the semester) have the added responsibility of preparing a two-page framing memo in advance of the scenario and facilitating discussion about the scenario in small groups; see further guidelines below.Â
